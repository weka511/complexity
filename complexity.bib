  abstract      = {In order to understand how the complex concept of entropy emerged, we propose a trip into the past, reviewing the works of Clausius, Boltzmann, Gibbs and Planck. In particular, since Gibbs's work is not very well known we present a detailed analysis, recalling the three definitions of entropy that Gibbs gives. The introduction of entropy in quantum mechanics gives in a compact form all the classical definitions of entropy. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of entropy is to see it as a thermodynamic potential like the others proposed by Callen. The calculation of fluctuations in thermodynamic quantities is thus naturally related to entropy. We close with some remarks on entropy and irreversibility. },

one-dimensional Cellular Automata (CA) as an example, we show how to construct local coarse-
grained descriptions of CA in all classes of Wolfram’s classification. The resulting coarse-grained CA
that we construct are capable of emulating the large-scale behavior of the original systems without
accounting for small-scale details. Several CA that can be coarse-grained by this construction are
known to be universal Turing machines; they can emulate any CA or other computing devices and
are therefore undecidable. We thus show that because in practice one only seeks coarse-grained
information, complex physical systems can be predictable and even decidable at some level of de-
scription. The renormalization group flows that we construct induce a hierarchy of CA rules. This
hierarchy agrees well with apparent rule complexity and is therefore a good candidate for a com-
plexity measure and a classification method. Finally we argue that the large scale dynamics of
CA can be very simple, at least when measured by the Kolmogorov complexity of the large scale
update rule, and moreover exhibits a novel scaling law. We show that because of this large-scale
simplicity, the probability of finding a coarse-grained description of CA approaches unity as one
goes to increasingly coarser scales. We interpret this large scale simplicity as a pattern formation
mechanism in which large scale patterns are forced upon the system by the simplicity of the rules
that govern the large scale dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Climate change during Late Ordovician mass extinction drove an ecologically selective decline in the abundance of deep-water macrozooplankton, accompanied by a shift to simpler, less even communities. These results indicate that the species abundance structure of planktic communities may be a leading indicator of the effects of climate change on biodiversity and a more sensitive gauge of those effects than taxonomic diversity change alone. Additionally, we present a Bayesian likelihood method of habitat inference that may be applicable to other similar cases.Mass extinctions disrupt ecological communities. Although climate changes produce stress in ecological communities, few paleobiological studies have systematically addressed the impact of global climate changes on the fine details of community structure with a view to understanding how changes in community structure presage, or even cause, biodiversity decline during mass extinctions. Based on a novel Bayesian approach to biotope assessment, we present a study of changes in species abundance distribution patterns of macroplanktonic graptolite faunas (\~{}447{\textendash}444 Ma) leading into the Late Ordovician mass extinction. Communities at two contrasting sites exhibit significant decreases in complexity and evenness as a consequence of the preferential decline in abundance of dysaerobic zone specialist species. The observed changes in community complexity and evenness commenced well before the dramatic population depletions that mark the tipping point of the extinction event. Initially, community changes tracked changes in the oceanic water masses, but these relations broke down during the onset of mass extinction. Environmental isotope and biomarker data suggest that sea surface temperature and nutrient cycling in the paleotropical oceans changed sharply during the latest Katian time, with consequent changes in the extent of the oxygen minimum zone and phytoplankton community composition. Although many impacted species persisted in ephemeral populations, increased extinction risk selectively depleted the diversity of paleotropical graptolite species during the latest Katian and early Hirnantian. The effects of long-term climate change on habitats can thus degrade populations in ways that cascade through communities, with effects that culminate in mass extinction.},
