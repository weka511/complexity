\section{Renormalization  and dimensional analysis}

\subsection{Renormalization}

Most of the basic ideas of this quarter originated from questions having to do with renormalization of the standard model. Renormalization is a combination of two things:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Learning how to eliminate out of the description of physics things arising from distances that are so small that they are irrelevant to the questions you are asking
	\item learning how to think about how dimensional analysis tells you how to answer some of the difficult questions about field theory that have to do with distances much smaller than you might be interested in.
\end{itemize}

Examples of getting rid of things that are too small to be of interest.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Studying the nucleus at protons and neutrons instead of quarks. Use QCD to figure out properties of protons and neutrons and their forces. Nucleons move slowly, so we can ignore relativity. Now forget quarks.
	\item For atoms, can forget nucleons.
\end{itemize}

The result is a coarse-grained description that is less accurate byt more useful.

In field theory each possible wavelength represents a degree of freedom. In describing things at one length scale we don't want to deal with shorter scales. We find a way to sum up the shorter stuff and replace by effective new parameters.

Example: atoms and atomic forces.

Small usually goes with fast.

Consider two atoms, each including a cloud of electrons. We want to replace Figure \ref{fig:3-2-atoms} with two simple atom,es with forces between them. Electrons are very fast compared to nuclei, so we cold almost think of atom as a bowling ball with little flies.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\caption{Two atoms with clouds of electrons}\label{fig:3-2-atoms}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{3-2-atoms}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

First approximation: the atoms are so heavy that they don't move at all. Start by writing down Hamiltonian.

\begin{align*}
	E=& \underbrace{\frac{P_1^2}{M} + \frac{P_2^2}{M} + \frac{e^2}{R_{12}}}_\text{protons} + \underbrace{\sum \frac{q^2}{2m} + \frac{e^2}{r_{ij}}- \frac{e^2}{R_{1i}} - \frac{e^2}{R_{2i}}}_\text{electrons} \numberthis \label{eq:hamiltonian:H2}
\end{align*}

There are two time scales:
\begin{itemize}
	\item slow for nuclei, which are heavy
	\item fast for electrons, which are a blur.
\end{itemize}

To a first approximation fix the protons and treat the Hamiltonian as being for electrons. We solve the Schr\"odinger equation for the lowest energy state, $E_{electrons}(R_1,R_2)$. Then (\ref{eq:hamiltonian:H2}) becomes:


\begin{align*}
E=& \underbrace{\frac{P_1^2}{M} + \frac{P_2^2}{M} + \frac{e^2}{R_{12}}}_\text{protons} +\underbrace{ E_{electrons}(R_1,R_2)}_\text{Part of potential energy}
\end{align*}

We don't have to think about electrons again. All renormalization is based on this idea. 

\subsection{Dimensional Analysis}

In physics we have three scales, distance, time, and mass, and we can get rid of two of them by setting:
\begin{align*}
	c=&1\\
	\hslash=& 1
\end{align*} 
but we still need one dimension, which we will take to be a length.

\begin{align*}
	[m] =& [E]\\
	=& [P]\\
	[l] =& [t]\\
	=& \frac{1}{[m]}
\end{align*}

\subsection{A typical quantum field theory}

Renormalizing a scalar field $\Phi$. Our Lagrangian is:

\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{L} =& (\partial_\mu \Phi)^2 - V(\Phi)\\
	S =& \int d^4 x \mathcal{L} \text{ action - same units as $\hslash=1$}
\end{align*}

This means that $\mathcal{L}$ had dimensions $[l^{-4}]$

\begin{align*}
	[(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x})^2]=l^{-4}\\
	[\Phi] = l^{-1}
\end{align*}
We imagine that the potential is something like:
\begin{align*}
	V(\Phi) =& \frac{m^2}{2} \Phi^2 + g \Phi^3 + \underbrace{\lambda}_\text{dimensionless} \Phi^4 \numberthis \label{eq:potential}
\end{align*}

Feynman diagrams are based on two things:
\begin{itemize}
	\item vertices, read off from V--Figure \ref{fig:3-1-feynman-vertices}
	\item propagators: represent motion from one point to another--Figure \ref{fig:3-1-feynman-propagator}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\caption{Elements of a Feynman diagram}
		\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
			\caption{Feynman Vertices for (\ref{eq:potential}). Cross in left hand vertex indicates absorption/re-emission}\label{fig:3-1-feynman-vertices}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{3-1-feynman-vertices}
		\end{subfigure}
			\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
			\caption{Propagator $\braket{0|\Phi(y)\Phi(x)|0}$: amplitude that particle created at $x$ found at $y$. Dimension $[l^-2]$--$\frac{1}{|x-y|^2} if no mass$. If x and y close, propagator blows up--this is the source of all divergences in QFT.}\label{fig:3-1-feynman-propagator}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{3-1-feynman-propagator}
	\end{subfigure}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Let's start with renormalization of the mass. Notice that (\ref{eq:potential}) contains $m^2$ -- usually mass only appears as $\sqrt{m^2}$. So what is renormalization of $m^2$? In Figure \ref{fig:3-1-feynman-vertices}, do we care if the emission and absorption points are really the same? We aren't interested in anything that is finer than the resolution of our accelerators, so if we can find a process that mimics vertex,  even if blurred, any process that absorbs and re-emits can be counted as part of mass term--for example Figure \ref{fig:3-1-feynman-mimic}.


\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Mimicking the Vertex}
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
		\caption{Particle emitted and returns to same point: scale so small we don't notice}\label{fig:3-1-feynman-mimic}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{3-1-feynman-mimic}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
		\caption{Amplitude following cut-off}\label{fig:3-1-cutoff}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{3-1-cutoff}
	\end{subfigure}
		\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
		\caption{Original mass term}\label{fig:3-1-original}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{3-1-original}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

We saw in Figure \ref{fig:3-1-feynman-propagator} that the propagator has amplitude:
\begin{align*}
	\braket{0|\Phi(y)\Phi(x)|0}=&\frac{1}{|x-y|^2}
\end{align*}

Let us introduce a cut-off, saying that we are not interested in scales smaller than $\delta$; we smear the point over $\delta$--Figure \ref{fig:3-1-cutoff}. Figure \ref{fig:3-1-original} shows the original mass term. If we include Figure \ref{fig:3-1-cutoff} we see that the effect of ignoring terms smaller than $\delta$ is to increase the effective mass: the amplitude becomes $\frac{m_0^2}{2}+\frac{1}{\delta^2}$.  \emph{This is what we'd see in the laboratory if our resolution isn't high enough to resolve lengths less than $\delta$.}  

But there are more Feynman diagrams!

\section{Fermions and bosons}

\subsection{Difference between Fermions and bosons}
Supersymmetry has to do with Fermions and Bosons, and their symmetries. We will Fermions and Bosons again, but, before that, we'll look at rotations.

Normally we are told that a rotation of $2\pi$ is equivalent to no rotation at all, but it is not true.

\begin{thm}[Rotation by $4\pi$ is equivalent to no rotation at all]
	Take a box, put a basketball in, and connect it to the walls with strings. A rotation by $2\pi$ tangles the strings; a rotation by $4\pi$ is equivalent to no rotation.
\end{thm}

Imagine that we have a particles, and we are interested in the spin $s$. What happens to the state when you rotate spin by $2\pi$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item apply string magnetic field and rotate;
	\item use field to precess particle.
\end{itemize}

Normally we'd expect it to come back to itself, but we know that $2\pi$ is not the identity. Perhaps it multiplies by a number. If we multiply by a phase, $\xi$, we won't be able to detect it. Multiplication by $4\pi$ squares phase, since it does nothing, so $\xi^2=1$, so $\xi=\pm1$.
\begin{align*}
	\ket{s} \rightarrow& +\ket{s} \text{, or}\\
	\ket{s} \rightarrow& -\ket{s}
\end{align*}

Can we detect this experimentally? It was long thought that we could not. If we take a family of electrons, all prepared identically, stick half into a magnetic field and rotate $2\pi$, we can't tell the two lots apart.

We can, however, do a 2 slit experiment\cite{aharonov1967observability}--Figure \ref{fig:particles3-2-2slit}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{A 2 slit experiment to detect rotation by $2\pi$}
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
		\begin{center}
			\caption{There is a magnetic field behind each slit, which traps electron temporarily. While an electron is trapped we rotate one field or the other, which can be detected in the interference pattern.}\label{fig:particles3-2-2slit}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{particles3-2-2slit}
		\end{center}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
	\begin{center}
		\caption{We create a superposition of two states, electron going through slit 1 or slit 2. In either case electron is in one box or the other. Now we rotate 2nd box by $2\pi$. The wave function for an electron changes sign, but this has no physical consequence on it own. For the superposition, if we rotate one electron wave function, we can never find electron at centre. $\psi_1$ and $psi_2$ will interfere.}\label{fig:particles3-2-2slit-wave-function-2-2slit}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{particles3-2-2slit-wave-function}
	\end{center}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

The experiment has been performed for Fermions (which get the minus sign), and Bosons (which don't). The result is also deeply embedded in the theory.

You cannot interfere an up spin with a down spin: you can only interfere things that are otherwise the same.

\subsection{Feynman Diagrams}

We'll be dealing with diagrams in the vacuum, with nothing more complicated than a single closed loop--Figures \ref{fig:particles3-2-loops} and \ref{fig:particles3-2-loops-boson}. This diagram controls, among other things, the amplitude that you start with nothing and get nothing. It is part of the vacuum structure. The diagram has a  value, which is a contribution to the vacuum energy. Just as Figure \ref{fig:particles3-2-loops-p} contributes to the energy of the particle, Figure \ref{fig:particles3-2-loops} and \ref{fig:particles3-2-loops-boson} contributes to the energy of the vacuum. Does it shift it up or down? Surprisingly the answer is different for Fermions and Bosons.

			--[fermion]e4[particle=$e^-$],
			e2--[photon,looseness=3.0,half left]e3
		};
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\begin{thm}[Contribution of loops to vacuum energy]
	The contribution to the vacuum energy of a loop of Bosons is positive;
	The contribution to the vacuum energy of a loop of Fermions is negative.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	You can think of a loop as the production and annihilation of a pair, or as a single particle looping in space-time. The sign of a particle in a loop can be either positive or negative. What about two loops--Figures \ref{fig:two:loops:fermion} and \ref{fig:two:loops:boson}? This is the product of two separate loops. So if there is a plus sign for one loop, there will be a plus sign for the product: if there is a minus sign for one loop, there will still be a plus sign for the product. So there will  be a plus sign for the product either way.

					b-- [quarter left]
					c-- [quarter left]
					d-- [anti fermion,quarter left] a,
				};
			\end{equation*}		
	\end{subfigure}
	\end{figure}
	Let's assume our particles are Fermions: lets break the loop and look in the middle at t=0--Figure \ref{fig:two:loops:split}. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What happens for amplitude of a system if we exchange two Bosons? Plus sign. 
		\item What happens for amplitude of a system if we exchange two Fermions? Minus sign. 
	\end{itemize}
	Now interchange particles, as in Figure \ref{fig:two:loops:interchange}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If we are dealing with Fermions we get a minus sign. We have gone from two loops (positive) to one loop, negative.
		\item If we are dealing with Bosons we get a plus sign.
	\end{itemize} 
\end{proof}

The consequences are profound:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the contribution to the vacuum of a Boson loop is positive;
	\item the contribution to the vacuum of a Fermion loop is negative.
\end{itemize}
We have this strange puzzle about the vacuum energy; it is extremely small, and we call it Dark Energy. The naive calculation in quantum field theory would give an answer 123 orders of magnitude larger.  We saw that the answer can be positive or negative: it depends on all sorts of things, such as mass and charge. We can at least get positive and negative signs. The fact that they cancel to 123 order of magnitude is bizarre, but we can cancel. All things being equal, a boson and a fermion will give exactly the same contribution, except for a different sign.

That doesn't mean that the vacuum energy is zero, but it suggest that maybe there is a lot of cancellation. To get an exact cancellation, we'd need for every boson with the same mass and same properties, then we could conceive that the particles would cancel out the vacuum energy.

We know that there isn't an exact Boson for each Fermion. For example, the electron: there isn't a Boson equivalent to the electron: if there were, the partners could be produced--Figure \ref{fig:partners}-- with exactly the same probability as an electron-positron pair--Figure \ref{fig:re:emit}. We know this isn't the case: Nature does not have a Boson$\leftrightarrow$Fermion symmetry.

	\begin{center}
		\caption{Why there isn't a Boson equivalent to the electron}
		\begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}

				a -- [photon,edge label=\(\gamma\)] b,

			};
		\end{subfigure}

				i2 [particle=\(e^{+}\)]
				-- [fermion] b
				-- [anti fermion] f2 [particle=\(e^{+}\)],
			};
		\end{subfigure}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

 Keep these two thoughts in mind.
\begin{itemize}
	\item  However, if we had a theory which was sufficiently symmetrical, we would at least have a chance of cancelling the vacuum energy.
	\item Can this also help with the self-energy of Bosons: we have quadratic infinities. Even if the initial mass is zero, we have diagrams that give us a huge mass.
\end{itemize}

Fermions don't have same problem with infinities. Now consider Figure \ref{fig:2loops}. In Figure \ref{fig:2loops:bosons} we have a Boson going round the loop, and in Figure \ref{fig:2loops:fermions} a Fermion. Fermion and Bosons always have opposites signs, so we can imagine, if everything were absolutely symmetrical, we might imagine things cancelling, so that self energy is not infinite.
