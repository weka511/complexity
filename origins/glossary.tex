\begin{abstract}
	These is my glossary for the SFI Origins of Life Course. I have put it together from terms that I have needed to look up as part of the course.
	This glossary is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
	but without any warranty, and without even the implied warranty of
	merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. All feedback is welcome,
	but I don't necessarily undertake to do anything with it\\
	\LaTeX source for this glossary can be found at\\
