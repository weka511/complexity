  abstract = {{Cells are the smallest known pieces of biology that are capable of independent reproduction and are therefore the simplest units that can evolve by conventional natural selection. This is problematic because even the simplest self-replicating cell-like entities seem to be too complicated to arise without the guiding hand of selection. To solve this conundrum, I argue that selection began before there were bounded entities in the form of neighborhood selection, an analog of group selection without bounded groups. This, I suggest, acted on chemical consortia bound to mineral surfaces to enhance their autocatalytic abilities. Then, selection for an ability to colonize new mineral surfaces resulted in the origin of propagules, which later evolved into free-living protocells. This model implies that much of life's complexity is the product of selection rather than of chance and that cells might arise predictably and rapidly in any environment with abundant free energy and appropriate chemical building blocks.}},

  abstract  = {The PVC superphylum is a grouping of distinct phyla of the domain bacteria proposed initially on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. It consists of a core of phyla Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae, but several other phyla have been considered to be members, including phylum Lentisphaerae and several other phyla consisting only of yet-to-be cultured members. The genomics-based links between Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae have been recently strengthened, but there appear to be other features which may confirm the relationship at least of Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Lentisphaerae. Remarkably these include the unique planctomycetal compartmentalized cell plan differing from the cell organization typical for bacteria. Such a shared cell plan suggests that the common ancestor of the PVC superphylum members may also have been compartmentalized, suggesting this is an evolutionarily homologous feature at least within the superphylum. Both the PVC endomembranes and the eukaryote-homologous membrane-coating MC proteins linked to endocytosis ability in Gemmata obscuriglobus and shared by PVC members suggest such homology may extend beyond the bacteria to the Eukarya. If so, either our definition of bacteria may have to change or PVC members admitted to be exceptions. The cases for and against considering the PVC superphylum members as exceptions to the bacteria are discussed, and arguments for them as exceptions presented. Recent critical analysis has favoured convergence and analogy for explaining eukaryote-like features in planctomycetes and other PVC organisms. The case is made for constructing hypotheses leaving the possibility of homology and evolutionary links to eukaryote features open. As the case of discovery of endocytosis-like protein uptake in planctomycetes has suggested, this may prove a strong basis for the immediate future of experimental research programs in the PVC scientific community.},

Current data suggests that eukaryotes may have risen from an archaeal lineage known as {\textquotedblleft}Asgard archaea{\textquotedblright}. Despite the eukaryote-like genomic features found in these archaea, the evolutionary transition from archaea to eukaryotes remains unclear due to the lack of cultured representatives and corresponding physiological insight. Here we report the decade-long isolation of a Lokiarchaeota-related Asgard archaeon from deep marine sediment. The archaeon, {\textquotedblleft}Candidatus Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum strain MK-D1{\textquotedblright}, is an anaerobic, extremely slow-growing, small cocci (\~{}550 nm), that degrades amino acids through syntrophy. Although eukaryote-like intracellular complexities have been proposed for Asgard archaea, the isolate has no visible organella-like structure. Ca. P. syntrophicum instead displays morphological complexity {\textendash} unique long, and often, branching protrusions. Based on cultivation and genomics, we propose an {\textquotedblleft}Entangle-Engulf-Enslave (E3) model{\textquotedblright} for eukaryogenesis through archaea-alphaproteobacteria symbiosis mediated by the physical complexities and metabolic dependency of the hosting archaeon.},

The notion of six eukaryotic 'supergroups' has recently gained some acceptance, and several papers in 2007 suggest that resolution of higher taxonomic levels is possible. However, in organisms that acquired photosynthesis via secondary (i.e. eukaryote-eukaryote) endosymbiosis, the host nuclear genome is a mosaic of genes derived from two (or more) nuclei, a fact that is often overlooked in studies attempting to reconstruct the deep evolutionary history of eukaryotes. Accurate identification of gene transfers and replacements involving eukaryotic donor and recipient genomes represents a potentially formidable challenge for the phylogenomics community as more protist genomes are sequenced and concatenated data sets grow.},

The distribution of the rates across the sequence positions generallyfits  aGdistribution.  Models  of  sequence  evolution  were  accordingly  designed  and  led  to  improved  phylogeneticreconstruction. However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that the evolutionary rate of a given position is notalways  constant  throughout  time.  We  called  such  within-site  rate  variations  heterotachy  (for  ‘‘different speed’’ inGreek). Yet, heterotachy was found among homologous sequences of distantly related organisms, often with differentfunctions. In such cases, the functional constraints are likely different, which would explain the different distributionof variable sites. To evaluate the importance of heterotachy, we focused on amino acid sequences of mitochondrialcytochromeb,for which the function is likely the same in all vertebrates. Using 2,038 sequences, we demonstratethat 95% of the variable positions are heterotachous, i.e., underwent dramatic variations of substitution rate amongvertebrate  lineages.  Heterotachy  even  occurs at  small evolutionary  scale,  and  in  these cases it is very unlikely tobe related to functional changes. Since a large number of sequences are required to efficiently detect heterotachy,the  extent  of  this phenomenon could not be  estimated for all proteins yet. It could be as large as for cytochromeb,since this protein is not a peculiar case. The observations made here open several new avenues of research, suchas the understanding of the evolution of functional constraints or the improvement of phylogenetic reconstruction mothods.},

  abstract  = {During the time, 3.2 x 109 years, that life has been present on Earth, the physical and
chemical conditions of most of the planetary surface have never varied from those
most favourable for life. The geological record reads that liquid water was always
present and that the pH was never far from neutral. During this same period, however,
the Earth’s radiation environment underwent large changes. As the sun moved along
the course set by the main sequence of stars its output will have increased at least
30 % and possibly 100 %. It may also have fluctuated in brightness over periods of a
few million years. At the same time hydrogen was escaping to space from the Earth
and so causing progressive changes in the chemical environment. This in turn through
atmospheric compositional changes could have affected the Earth’s radiation balance.
It may have been that these physical and chemical changes always by blind chance
followed the path whose bounds are the conditions favouring the continued existence
of life. This paper offers an alternative explanation that, early after life began it
acquired control of the planetary environment and that this homeostasis by and for
the biosphere has persisted ever since. Historic and contemporary evidence and argu-
ments for this hypothesis will be presented.},

  abstract  = {Chloroplasts were once free-living cyanobacteria that became endosymbionts, but the genomes of contemporary plastids encode only ≈5–10% as many genes as those of their free-living cousins, indicating that many genes were either lost from plastids or transferred to the nucleus during the course of plant evolution. Previous estimates have suggested that between 800 and perhaps as many as 2,000 genes in the Arabidopsis genome might come from cyanobacteria, but genome-wide phylogenetic surveys that could provide direct estimates of this number are lacking. We compared 24,990 proteins encoded in the Arabidopsis genome to the proteins from three cyanobacterial genomes, 16 other prokaryotic reference genomes, and yeast. Of 9,368 Arabidopsis proteins sufficiently conserved for primary sequence comparison, 866 detected homologues only among cyanobacteria and 834 other branched with cyanobacterial homologues in phylogenetic trees. Extrapolating from these conserved proteins to the whole genome, the data suggest that ≈4,500 of Arabidopsis protein-coding genes (≈18% of the total) were acquired from the cyanobacterial ancestor of plastids. These proteins encompass all functional classes, and the majority of them are targeted to cell compartments other than the chloroplast. Analysis of 15 sequenced chloroplast genomes revealed 117 nuclear-encoded proteins that are also still present in at least one chloroplast genome. A phylogeny of chloroplast genomes inferred from 41 proteins and 8,303 amino acids sites indicates that at least two independent secondary endosymbiotic events have occurred involving red algae and that amino acid composition bias in chloroplast proteins strongly affects plastid genome phylogeny.},

  abstract  = {A common outcome of antibiotic exposure in patients and in vitro is the evolution of a hypermutator phenotype that enables rapid adaptation by pathogens. While hypermutation is a robust mechanism for rapid adaptation, it requires trade-offs between the adaptive mutations and the more common “hitchhiker” mutations that accumulate from the increased mutation rate. Using quantitative experimental evolution, we examined the role of hypermutation in driving the adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to colistin. Metagenomic deep sequencing revealed 2,657 mutations at ≥5% frequency in 1,197 genes and 761 mutations in 29 endpoint isolates. By combining genomic information, phylogenetic analyses, and statistical tests, we showed that evolutionary trajectories leading to resistance could be reliably discerned. In addition to known alleles such as pmrB, hypermutation allowed identification of additional adaptive alleles with epistatic relationships. Although hypermutation provided a short-term fitness benefit, it was detrimental to overall fitness. Alarmingly, a small fraction of the colistin-adapted population remained colistin susceptible and escaped hypermutation. In a clinical population, such cells could play a role in reestablishing infection upon withdrawal of colistin. We present here a framework for evaluating the complex evolutionary trajectories of hypermutators that applies to both current and emerging pathogen populations.},

We are particularly interested in differences between the performance of the whole colony and the individuals composing it. Much of our work centers on nest-site selection by Temnothorax ants. We have discovered that individual ants are prone to irrational changes in site preference when presented with certain challenging decision problems. Similar irrationality is well known in many animals, including humans. However, when colonies received the same challenge, they showed rationally consistent preferences. This suggests that groups can improve the quality of their decision-making by sharing their cognitive burden across many individuals.},
