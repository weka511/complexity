  abstract  = {Background: To understand the evolutionary role of Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT), accurate methods are needed to identify transferred genes and infer their timing of acquisition. Phylogenetic methods are particularly promising for this purpose, but the reconciliation of a gene tree with a reference (species) tree is computationally hard. In addition, the application of these methods to real data raises the problem of sorting out real and artifactual phylogenetic conflict.

Results: We present Prunier, a new method for phylogenetic detection of LGT based on the search for a maximum statistical agreement forest (MSAF) between a gene tree and a reference tree. The program is flexible as it can use any definition of "agreement" among trees. We evaluate the performance of Prunier and two other programs (EEEP and RIATA-HGT) for their ability to detect transferred genes in realistic simulations where gene trees are reconstructed from sequences. Prunier proposes a single scenario that compares to the other methods in terms of sensitivity, but shows higher specificity. We show that LGT scenarios carry a strong signal about the position of the root of the species tree and could be used to identify the direction of evolutionary time on the species tree. We use Prunier on a biological dataset of 23 universal proteins and discuss their suitability for inferring the tree of life.

Conclusions: The ability of Prunier to take into account branch support in the process of reconciliation allows a gain in complexity, in comparison to EEEP, and in accuracy in comparison to RIATA-HGT. Prunier's greedy algorithm proposes a single scenario of LGT for a gene family, but its quality always compares to the best solutions provided by the other algorithms. When the root position is uncertain in the species tree, Prunier is able to infer a scenario per root at a limited additional computational cost and can easily run on large datasets.Prunier is implemented in C++, using the Bio++ library and the phylogeny program Treefinder.

  abstract  = {Lateral gene transfer (LGT), the acquisition of genes from other species, is a major evolutionary force. However, its success as an adaptive process makes the reconstruction of the history of life an intricate puzzle: If no gene has remained unaffected during the course of life's evolution, how can one rely on molecular markers to reconstruct the relationships among species? Here, we take a completely different look at LGT and its impact for the reconstruction of the history of life. Rather than trying to remove the effect of LGT in phylogenies, and ignoring as a result most of the information of gene histories, we use an explicit phylogenetic model of gene transfer to reconcile gene histories with the tree of species. We studied 16 bacterial and archaeal phyla, representing a dataset of 12,000 gene families distributed in 336 genomes. Our results show that, in most phyla, LGT provides an abundant phylogenetic signal on the pattern of species diversification and that this signal is robust to the choice of gene families under study. We also find that LGT brings an abundant signal on the location of the root of species trees, which has been previously overlooked. Our results quantify the great variety of gene transfer rates among lineages of the tree of life and provide strong support for the "complexity hypothesis," which states that genes whose products participate to macromolecular protein complexes are relatively resistant to transfer.},

  abstract  = {Water creates special problems for prebiotic chemistry, as it is thermodynamically favorable for amide and phosphodiester bonds to hydrolyze. The availability of alternative solvents with more favorable properties for the formation of prebiotic molecules on the early Earth may have helped bypass this so-called “water paradox”. Formamide (FA) is one such solvent, and can serve as a nucleobase precursor, but it is difficult to envision how FA could have been generated in large quantities or accumulated in terrestrial surface environments. We report here the conversion of aqueous acetonitrile (ACN) via hydrogen cyanide (HCN) as an intermediate into FA by γ-irradiation under conditions mimicking exposure to radioactive minerals. We estimate that a radioactive placer deposit could produce 0.1‒0.8 mol FA km−2 year−1. A uraninite fission zone comparable to the Oklo reactors in Gabon can produce 0.1‒1 mol m−2 year−1, orders of magnitude greater than other scenarios of FA production or delivery for which reaching sizeable concentrations of FA are problematic. Radioactive mineral deposits may be favorable settings for prebiotic compound formation through emergent geologic processes and FA-mediated organic chemistry.},

  abstract  = {The ability to monitor and perturb RNAs in living cells would benefit greatly from a modular protein architecture that targets unmodified RNA sequences in a programmable way. We report that the RNA-binding protein PumHD (Pumilio homology domain), which has been widely used in native and modified form for targeting RNA, can be engineered to yield a set of four canonical protein modules, each of which targets one RNA base. These modules (which we call Pumby, for Pumilio-based assembly) can be concatenated in chains of varying composition and length, to bind desired target RNAs. The specificity of such Pumby-RNA interactions was high, with undetectable binding of a Pumby chain to RNA sequences that bear three or more mismatches from the target sequence. We validate that the Pumby architecture can perform RNA-directed protein assembly and enhancement of translation of RNAs. We further demonstrate a new use of such RNA-binding proteins, measurement of RNA translation in living cells. Pumby may prove useful for many applications in the measurement, manipulation, and biotechnological utilization of unmodified RNAs in intact cells and systems.},

  abstract      = {The origin of life can be understood mathematically to be the origin of information that can replicate. The likelihood that entropy spontaneously becomes information can be calculated from first principles, and depends exponentially on the amount of information that is necessary for replication. We do not know what the minimum amount of information for self-replication is because it must depend on the local chemistry, but we can study how this likelihood behaves in different known chemistries, and we can study ways in which this likelihood can be enhanced. Here we present evidence from numerical simulations (using the digital life chemistry "Avida") that using a biased probability distribution for the creation of monomers (the "biased typewriter") can exponentially increase the likelihood of spontaneous emergence of information from entropy. We show that this likelihood may depend on the length of the sequence that the information is embedded in, but in a non-trivial manner: there may be an optimum sequence length that maximizes the likelihood. We conclude that the likelihood of spontaneous emergence of self-replication is much more malleable than previously thought, and that the biased probability distributions of monomers that are the norm in biochemistry may significantly enhance these likelihoods},

  abstract  = {Nitrogen is a critical ingredient of complex biological molecules. Molecular nitrogen, however, which was outgassed into the Earth’s early atmosphere, is relatively chemically inert and nitrogen fixation into more chemically reactive compounds requires high temperatures. Possible mechanisms of nitrogen fixation include lightning, atmospheric shock heating by meteorites, and solar ultraviolet radiation. Here we show that nitrogen fixation in the early terrestrial atmosphere can be explained by frequent and powerful coronal mass ejection events from the young Sun—so-called superflares. Using magnetohydrodynamic simulations constrained by Kepler Space Telescope observations, we find that successive superflare ejections produce shocks that accelerate energetic particles, which would have compressed the early Earth’s magnetosphere. The resulting extended polar cap openings provide pathways for energetic particles to penetrate into the atmosphere and, according to our atmospheric chemistry simulations, initiate reactions converting molecular nitrogen, carbon dioxide and methane to the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide as well as hydrogen cyanide, an essential compound for life. Furthermore, the destruction of N2, CO2 and CH4 suggests that these greenhouse gases cannot explain the stability of liquid water on the early Earth. Instead, we propose that the efficient formation of nitrous oxide could explain a warm early Earth.},

This is problematic because even the simplest self-replicating cell-like entities seem to be too complicated to arise without the guiding hand of selection. To solve this conundrum, I argue that selection began before there were bounded entities in the form of neighborhood selection, an analog of group selection without bounded groups. This, I suggest, acted on chemical consortia bound to mineral surfaces to enhance their autocatalytic abilities. Then, selection for an ability to colonize new mineral surfaces resulted in the origin of propagules, which later evolved into free-living protocells. This model implies that much of life's complexity is the product of selection rather than of chance and that cells might arise predictably and rapidly in any environment with abundant free energy and appropriate chemical building blocks.}},

  abstract  = {Hohwy (Hohwy 2016, Hohwy 2017) argues there is a tension between the free energy principle and leading depictions of mind as embodied, enactive, and ex-tended (so-called ‘EEE1 cognition’). The tension is traced to the importance, in free energy formulations, of a conception of mind and agency that depends upon the presence of a ‘Markov blanket’ demarcating the agent from the surrounding world. In what follows I show that the Markov blanket considerations do not, in fact, lead to the kinds of tension that Hohwy depicts. On the contrary, they ac-tively favour the EEE story. This is because the Markov property, as exemplified in biological agents, picks out neither a unique nor a stationary boundary. It is this multiplicity and mutability– rather than the absence of agent-environment boundaries as such - that EEE cognition celebrates},

Here, we demonstrate a prebiotically plausible mechanism for peptide (amide) bond formation that is enabled by α‐hydroxy acids, which were likely present along with amino acids on the early Earth. Together, α‐hydroxy acids and α‐amino acids form depsipeptides—oligomers with a combination of ester and amide linkages—in model prebiotic reactions that are driven by wet–cool/dry–hot cycles. Through a combination of ester–amide bond exchange and ester bond hydrolysis, depsipeptides are enriched with amino acids over time. These results support a long‐standing hypothesis that peptides might have arisen from ester‐based precursors},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a heuristic proof (and simulations of a primordial soup)
suggesting that life—or biological self-organization—is an inevitable and
emergent property of any (ergodic) random dynamical system that possesses
a Markov blanket. This conclusion is based on the following arguments: if
the coupling among an ensemble of dynamical systems is mediated by
short-range forces, then the states of remote systems must be conditionally
independent. These independencies induce a Markov blanket that separates
internal and external states in a statistical sense. The existence of a Markov
blanket means that internal states will appear to minimize a free energy
functional of the states of their Markov blanket. Crucially, this is the same
quantity that is optimized in Bayesian inference. Therefore, the internal
states (and their blanket) will appear to engage in active Bayesian inference.
In other words, they will appear to model—and act on—their world to pre-
serve their functional and structural integrity, leading to homoeostasis and a
simple form of autopoiesis.},

  abstract  = {The PVC superphylum is a grouping of distinct phyla of the domain bacteria proposed initially on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. It consists of a core of phyla Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae, but several other phyla have been considered to be members, including phylum Lentisphaerae and several other phyla consisting only of yet-to-be cultured members. The genomics-based links between Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae have been recently strengthened, but there appear to be other features which may confirm the relationship at least of Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Lentisphaerae. Remarkably these include the unique planctomycetal compartmentalized cell plan differing from the cell organization typical for bacteria. Such a shared cell plan suggests that the common ancestor of the PVC superphylum members may also have been compartmentalized, suggesting this is an evolutionarily homologous feature at least within the superphylum. Both the PVC endomembranes and the eukaryote-homologous membrane-coating MC proteins linked to endocytosis ability in Gemmata obscuriglobus and shared by PVC members suggest such homology may extend beyond the bacteria to the Eukarya. If so, either our definition of bacteria may have to change or PVC members admitted to be exceptions. The cases for and against considering the PVC superphylum members as exceptions to the bacteria are discussed, and arguments for them as exceptions presented. Recent critical analysis has favoured convergence and analogy for explaining eukaryote-like features in planctomycetes and other PVC organisms. The case is made for constructing hypotheses leaving the possibility of homology and evolutionary links to eukaryote features open. As the case of discovery of endocytosis-like protein uptake in planctomycetes has suggested, this may prove a strong basis for the immediate future of experimental research programs in the PVC scientific community.},

  pages     = {29},
  abstract  = {Since the reclassification of all life forms in three Domains (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya), the identity of their alleged forerunner (Last Universal Common Ancestor or LUCA) has been the subject of extensive controversies: progenote or already complex organism, prokaryote or protoeukaryote, thermophile or mesophile, product of a protracted progression from simple replicators to complex cells or born in the cradle of "catalytically closed" entities? We present a critical survey of the topic and suggest a scenario.

LUCA does not appear to have been a simple, primitive, hyperthermophilic prokaryote but rather a complex community of protoeukaryotes with a RNA genome, adapted to a broad range of moderate temperatures, genetically redundant, morphologically and metabolically diverse. LUCA's genetic redundancy predicts loss of paralogous gene copies in divergent lineages to be a significant source of phylogenetic anomalies, i.e. instances where a protein tree departs from the SSU-rRNA genealogy; consequently, horizontal gene transfer may not have the rampant character assumed by many. Examining membrane lipids suggest LUCA had sn1,2 ester fatty acid lipids from which Archaea emerged from the outset as thermophilic by "thermoreduction," with a new type of membrane, composed of sn2,3 ether isoprenoid lipids; this occurred without major enzymatic reconversion. Bacteria emerged by reductive evolution from LUCA and some lineages further acquired extreme thermophily by convergent evolution. This scenario is compatible with the hypothesis that the RNA to DNA transition resulted from different viral invasions as proposed by Forterre. Beyond the controversy opposing "replication first" to metabolism first", the predictive arguments of theories on "catalytic closure" or "compositional heredity" heavily weigh in favour of LUCA's ancestors having emerged as complex, self-replicating entities from which a genetic code arose under natural selection.

Life was born complex and the LUCA displayed that heritage. It had the "body "of a mesophilic eukaryote well before maturing by endosymbiosis into an organism adapted to an atmosphere rich in oxygen. Abundant indications suggest reductive evolution of this complex and heterogeneous entity towards the "prokaryotic" Domains Archaea and Bacteria. The word "prokaryote" should be abandoned because epistemologically unsound.},

Current data suggests that eukaryotes may have risen from an archaeal lineage known as {\textquotedblleft}Asgard archaea{\textquotedblright}. Despite the eukaryote-like genomic features found in these archaea, the evolutionary transition from archaea to eukaryotes remains unclear due to the lack of cultured representatives and corresponding physiological insight. Here we report the decade-long isolation of a Lokiarchaeota-related Asgard archaeon from deep marine sediment. The archaeon, {\textquotedblleft}Candidatus Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum strain MK-D1{\textquotedblright}, is an anaerobic, extremely slow-growing, small cocci (\~{}550 nm), that degrades amino acids through syntrophy. Although eukaryote-like intracellular complexities have been proposed for Asgard archaea, the isolate has no visible organella-like structure. Ca. P. syntrophicum instead displays morphological complexity {\textendash} unique long, and often, branching protrusions. Based on cultivation and genomics, we propose an {\textquotedblleft}Entangle-Engulf-Enslave (E3) model{\textquotedblright} for eukaryogenesis through archaea-alphaproteobacteria symbiosis mediated by the physical complexities and metabolic dependency of the hosting archaeon.},

does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual
cells to Home sapiens, in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the
active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov
blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we con-
sider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global
system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration
of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested
and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living
system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems
need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organ-
ism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of
Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual
cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements
of the local environment.},

The notion of six eukaryotic 'supergroups' has recently gained some acceptance, and several papers in 2007 suggest that resolution of higher taxonomic levels is possible. However, in organisms that acquired photosynthesis via secondary (i.e. eukaryote-eukaryote) endosymbiosis, the host nuclear genome is a mosaic of genes derived from two (or more) nuclei, a fact that is often overlooked in studies attempting to reconstruct the deep evolutionary history of eukaryotes. Accurate identification of gene transfers and replacements involving eukaryotic donor and recipient genomes represents a potentially formidable challenge for the phylogenomics community as more protist genomes are sequenced and concatenated data sets grow.},

The distribution of the rates across the sequence positions generallyfits  aGdistribution.  Models  of  sequence  evolution  were  accordingly  designed  and  led  to  improved  phylogeneticreconstruction. However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that the evolutionary rate of a given position is notalways  constant  throughout  time.  We  called  such  within-site  rate  variations  heterotachy  (for  ‘‘different speed’’ inGreek). Yet, heterotachy was found among homologous sequences of distantly related organisms, often with differentfunctions. In such cases, the functional constraints are likely different, which would explain the different distributionof variable sites. To evaluate the importance of heterotachy, we focused on amino acid sequences of mitochondrialcytochromeb,for which the function is likely the same in all vertebrates. Using 2,038 sequences, we demonstratethat 95% of the variable positions are heterotachous, i.e., underwent dramatic variations of substitution rate amongvertebrate  lineages.  Heterotachy  even  occurs at  small evolutionary  scale,  and  in  these cases it is very unlikely tobe related to functional changes. Since a large number of sequences are required to efficiently detect heterotachy,the  extent  of  this phenomenon could not be  estimated for all proteins yet. It could be as large as for cytochromeb,since this protein is not a peculiar case. The observations made here open several new avenues of research, suchas the understanding of the evolution of functional constraints or the improvement of phylogenetic reconstruction mothods.},

  abstract  = {During the time, 3.2 x 109 years, that life has been present on Earth, the physical and
chemical conditions of most of the planetary surface have never varied from those
most favourable for life. The geological record reads that liquid water was always
present and that the pH was never far from neutral. During this same period, however,
the Earth’s radiation environment underwent large changes. As the sun moved along
the course set by the main sequence of stars its output will have increased at least
30 % and possibly 100 %. It may also have fluctuated in brightness over periods of a
few million years. At the same time hydrogen was escaping to space from the Earth
and so causing progressive changes in the chemical environment. This in turn through
atmospheric compositional changes could have affected the Earth’s radiation balance.
It may have been that these physical and chemical changes always by blind chance
followed the path whose bounds are the conditions favouring the continued existence

  abstract  = {Chloroplasts were once free-living cyanobacteria that became endosymbionts, but the genomes of contemporary plastids encode only ≈5–10% as many genes as those of their free-living cousins, indicating that many genes were either lost from plastids or transferred to the nucleus during the course of plant evolution. Previous estimates have suggested that between 800 and perhaps as many as 2,000 genes in the Arabidopsis genome might come from cyanobacteria, but genome-wide phylogenetic surveys that could provide direct estimates of this number are lacking. We compared 24,990 proteins encoded in the Arabidopsis genome to the proteins from three cyanobacterial genomes, 16 other prokaryotic reference genomes, and yeast. Of 9,368 Arabidopsis proteins sufficiently conserved for primary sequence comparison, 866 detected homologues only among cyanobacteria and 834 other branched with cyanobacterial homologues in phylogenetic trees. Extrapolating from these conserved proteins to the whole genome, the data suggest that ≈4,500 of Arabidopsis protein-coding genes (≈18% of the total) were acquired from the cyanobacterial ancestor of plastids. These proteins encompass all functional classes, and the majority of them are targeted to cell compartments other than the chloroplast. Analysis of 15 sequenced chloroplast genomes revealed 117 nuclear-encoded proteins that are also still present in at least one chloroplast genome. A phylogeny of chloroplast genomes inferred from 41 proteins and 8,303 amino acids sites indicates that at least two independent secondary endosymbiotic events have occurred involving red algae and that amino acid composition bias in chloroplast proteins strongly affects plastid genome phylogeny.},

These membranes are proposed to have been formed out of single chain amphiphiles, which are less stable than the dialkyl lipids used to form modern membranes. This lack of stability, specifically for decanoate, is often used to refute ocean locations for the origins of life. This review addresses the formation of membranes in hydrothermal-vent like conditions, as well as other environmental constraints. Specifically, single chain amphiphiles can form membranes at high sea salt concentrations (150 g/L), high temperatures (65 °C), and a wide pH range (2 to 10). It additionally discusses the major challenges and advantages of membrane formation in both ocean and fresh water locations.},

  abstract  = {A hypothesis in prebiotic chemistry argues that organics were delivered to the early Earth in abundance by meteoritic sources. This study tests that hypothesis by measuring how the transfer of organic matter to the surface of Earth is affected by energy-dissipation processes such as ablation and airbursts. Exogenous delivery has been relied upon as a source of primordial material, but it must stand to reason that other avenues (i.e., hydrothermal vents, electric discharge) played a bigger role in the formation of life as we know it on Earth if exogenous material was unable to deliver significant quantities of organics. For this study, we look at various properties of meteors such as initial velocity and mass of the object, and atmospheric composition to see how meteors with different initial velocities and masses ablate. We find that large meteors do not slow down fast enough and thus impact the surface, vaporizing their components; fast meteors with low masses are vaporized during entry; and meteors with low velocities and high initial masses reach the surface. For those objects that survive to reach the surface, about 60 to >99% of the mass is lost by ablation. Large meteors that fragment are also shown to spread out over increasingly larger areas with increasing mass, and small meteors (~1 mm) are subjected to intense thermal heating, potentially degrading intrinsic organics. These findings are generally true across most atmospheric compositions. These findings provide several caveats to extraterrestrial delivery models that—while a viable point source of organics—likely did not supply as much prebiotic material as an effective endogenous production route},

  abstract  = {A common outcome of antibiotic exposure in patients and in vitro is the evolution of a hypermutator phenotype that enables rapid adaptation by pathogens. While hypermutation is a robust mechanism for rapid adaptation, it requires trade-offs between the adaptive mutations and the more common “hitchhiker” mutations that accumulate from the increased mutation rate. Using quantitative experimental evolution, we examined the role of hypermutation in driving the adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to colistin. Metagenomic deep sequencing revealed 2,657 mutations at ≥5% frequency in 1,197 genes and 761 mutations in 29 endpoint isolates. By combining genomic information, phylogenetic analyses, and statistical tests, we showed that evolutionary trajectories leading to resistance could be reliably discerned. In addition to known alleles such as pmrB, hypermutation allowed identification of additional adaptive alleles with epistatic relationships. Although hypermutation provided a short-term fitness benefit, it was detrimental to overall fitness. Alarmingly, a small fraction of the colistin-adapted population remained colistin susceptible and escaped hypermutation. In a clinical population, such cells could play a role in reestablishing infection upon withdrawal of colistin. We present here a framework for evaluating the complex evolutionary trajectories of hypermutators that applies to both current and emerging pathogen populations.},

In this model, the ribosome evolved by accretion, recursively adding expansion segments, iteratively growing, subsuming, and freezing the rRNA. Functions of expansion segments in the ancestral ribosome are assigned by correspondence with their functions in the extant ribosome. The model explains the evolution of the large ribosomal subunit, the small ribosomal subunit, tRNA, and mRNA. Prokaryotic ribosomes evolved in six phases, sequentially acquiring capabilities for RNA folding, catalysis, subunit association, correlated evolution, decoding, energy-driven translocation, and surface proteinization. Two additional phases exclusive to eukaryotes led to tentacle-like rRNA expansions. In this model, ribosomal proteinization was a driving force for the broad adoption of proteins in other biological processes. The exit tunnel was clearly a central theme of all phases of ribosomal evolution and was continuously extended and rigidified. In the primitive noncoding ribosome, proto-mRNA and the small ribosomal subunit acted as cofactors, positioning the activated ends of tRNAs within the peptidyl transferase center. This association linked the evolution of the large and small ribosomal subunits, proto-mRNA, and tRNA.},

We are particularly interested in differences between the performance of the whole colony and the individuals composing it. Much of our work centers on nest-site selection by Temnothorax ants. We have discovered that individual ants are prone to irrational changes in site preference when presented with certain challenging decision problems. Similar irrationality is well known in many animals, including humans. However, when colonies received the same challenge, they showed rationally consistent preferences. This suggests that groups can improve the quality of their decision-making by sharing their cognitive burden across many individuals.},

ontology of biological systems called variational neuroethology, which integrates the FEP with Tinbergen’s four research questions
to explain biological systems across spatial and temporal scales. We exemplify this framework by applying it to Homo sapiens,
before translating variational neuroethology into a systematic research heuristic that supplies the biological, cognitive, and social
sciences with a computationally tractable guide to discovery.},

In principle, the free energy of a redox reaction catalysed by a membrane-boundelectron transport chain is transduced via the generation of an electrochemical ion (usually proton) gradientacross a coupling membrane that drives ATP synthesis. The proton motive force (pmf) can be built up bydifferent mechanisms like proton pumping, quinone/quinol cycling or by a redox loop. The latter coupleselectron transport to a net proton transfer across the membrane without proton pumping. Instead, chargeseparation is achieved by quinone-reactive enzymes or enzyme complexes whose active sites for substratesand quinones are situated on different sides of the coupling membrane. The necessary transmembraneelectron transport is usually accomplished by the presence of two haem groups that face opposite sides of themembrane. There are many different enzyme complexes that are part of redox loops and their catalysedredox reactions can be either electrogenic, electroneutral (non-proton motive) or evenpmf-consuming. Thisarticle gives conceptual classification of different operational organisations of redox loops and uses this as aplatform from which to explore the biodiversity of quinone/quinol-cycling redox systems.},

Yet there is strikingly little resemblance between much of this chemistry and the metabolic pathways of cells, in terms of substrates, catalysts, and synthetic pathways. In contrast, alkalinehydrothermal vents offer conditions similar to those harnessed by modern autotrophs, but there has been limitedexperimental evidence that such conditions could drive prebiotic chemistry. In the Hadean, in the absence ofoxygen, alkaline vents are proposed to have acted as electrochemical flow reactors, in which alkaline fluidssaturated in H2mixed with relatively acidic ocean waters rich in CO2, through a labyrinth of interconnectedmicropores with thin inorganic walls containing catalytic Fe(Ni)S minerals. The difference in pH across thesethin barriers produced natural proton gradients with equivalent magnitude and polarity to the proton-motiveforce required for carbon fixation in extant bacteria and archaea. How such gradients could have poweredcarbon reduction or energy flux before the advent of organic protocells with genes and proteins is unknown. Work over the last decade suggests several possible hypotheses that are currently being tested in laboratoryexperiments, field observations, and phylogenetic reconstructions of ancestral metabolism. We analyze theperplexing differences in carbon and energy metabolism in methanogenic archaea and acetogenic bacteria topropose a possible ancestral mechanism of CO2reduction in alkaline hydrothermal vents. Based on thismechanism, we show that the evolution of active ion pumping could have driven the deep divergence ofbacteria and archaea. },

  abstract  = {Autotrophic theories for the origin of life propose that CO2 was the carbon source for primordial biosynthesis. Among the six known CO2 fixation pathways in nature, the acetyl-CoA (AcCoA; or Wood–Ljungdahl) pathway is the most ancient, and relies on transition metals for catalysis. Modern microbes that use the AcCoA pathway typically fix CO2 with electrons from H2, which requires complex flavin-based electron bifurcation. This presents a paradox: how could primitive metabolic systems have fixed CO2  before  the  origin  of  proteins?  Here,  we  show  that  native  transition  metals  (Fe0,  Ni0  and  Co0)  selectively  reduce  CO2  to  acetate and pyruvate—the intermediates and end-products of the AcCoA pathway—in near millimolar concentrations in water over  hours  to  days  using  1–40 bar  CO2  and  at  temperatures  from  30  to  100 °C.  Geochemical  CO2  fixation  from  native  metals  could have supplied critical C2 and C3 metabolites before the emergence of enzymes.},

One possibility is that the first evolvers were chemical ecosystems localized on mineral surfaces and composed of sets of molecular species that could catalyze each other’s formation. We used a bottom-up experimental framework, chemical ecosystem selection (CES), to evaluate this perspective and search for surface-associated and mutually catalytic chemical systems based on the changes in chemistry that they are expected to induce. Here, we report the results of preliminary CES experiments conducted using a synthetic “prebiotic soup” and pyrite grains, which yielded dynamical patterns that are suggestive of the emergence of mutual catalysis. While more research is needed to better understand the specific patterns observed here and determine whether they are reflective of self-propagation, these results illustrate the potential power of CES to test competing hypotheses for the emergence of protobiological chemical systems.},

We investigated all clusters andphylogenetic trees for 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes in order to reconstruct themicrobial ecology of LUCA. Among 286,514 protein clusters, we identified 355 protein families (∼0.1%) that trace toLUCA by phylogenetic criteria. Because these proteins are not universally distributed, they can shed light on LUCA’sphysiology. Their functions, properties and prosthetic groups depict LUCA as anaerobic, CO2-fixing, H2-dependent with aWood–Ljungdahl pathway, N2-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA’s biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radicalreaction mechanisms. Its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals,flavins,S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A,ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications andS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylations. The 355 phylogenies identify clostridia and methanogens, whose modern lifestylesresemble that of LUCA, as basal among their respective domains. LUCA inhabited a geochemically active environment richin H2,CO2and iron. The data support the theory of an autotrophic origin of life involving the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway ina hydrothermal sett},

  abstract  = {A theory for the evolution of cellular organization is presented. The model is based on the (data supported) conjecture that the dynamic of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is primarily determined by the organization of the recipient cell. Aboriginal cell designs are taken to be simple and loosely organized enough that all cellular componentry can be altered and/or displaced through HGT, making HGT the principal driving force in early cellular evolution. Primitive cells did not carry a stable organismal genealogical trace. Primitive cellular evolution is basically communal. The high level of novelty required to evolve cell designs is a product of communal invention, of the universal HGT field, not intralineage variation. It is the community as a whole, the ecosystem, which evolves. The individual cell designs that evolved in this way are nevertheless fundamentally distinct, because the initial conditions in each case are somewhat different. As a cell design becomes more complex and interconnected a critical point is reached where a more integrated cellular organization emerges, and vertically generated novelty can and does assume greater importance. This critical point is called the “Darwinian Threshold” for the reasons given.},

  abstract = {The nature of the first genetic polymer is the subject of major debate. Although the ‘RNA world’ theory suggests that RNA was the first replicable information carrier of the prebiotic era—that is, prior to the dawn of life—other evidence implies that life may have started with a heterogeneous nucleic acid genetic system that included both RNA and DNA. Such a theory streamlines the eventual ‘genetic takeover’ of homogeneous DNA from RNA as the principal information-storage molecule, but requires a selective abiotic synthesis of both RNA and DNA building blocks in the same local primordial geochemical scenario. Here we demonstrate a high-yielding, completely stereo-, regio- and furanosyl-selective prebiotic synthesis of the purine deoxyribonucleosides: deoxyadenosine and deoxyinosine. Our synthesis uses key intermediates in the prebiotic synthesis of the canonical pyrimidine ribonucleosides (cytidine and uridine), and we show that, once generated, the pyrimidines persist throughout the synthesis of the purine deoxyribonucleosides, leading to a mixture of deoxyadenosine, deoxyinosine, cytidine and uridine. These results support the notion that purine deoxyribonucleosides and pyrimidine ribonucleosides may have coexisted before the emergence of life.},
