\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Welcome To The Course}
\subsection{Life}
Lecturer: David Baum
\subsubsection{Easy or hard?}
The extremes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We need to wait billions of years for specific conditions: even hospitable planets lack life--Figure \ref{fig:luca}.
	\item New life can evolve quickly whenever conditions are ripe:  New life could emerge in the lab--Figure \ref{fig:zircons}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Life is hard: All life we know of traces back to a single 		ancestor}\label{fig:luca}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Zircons}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Life preempts Life: ''But if (\& oh what a big if) we could conceive in some warm little pond with all sorts of ammonia \& phosphoric salts,—light, heat, electricity \&c present, that a protein compound was chemically formed, ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured, or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed''--Charles Darwin\cite{darwin1871letter}.
	
	\item Would we recognize alt-life?
	
	\item Some theories allow life to originate easily\cite{wachtershauser1988before}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The meaning of ''life''}
Life as we know it (''LAWKI'') shares many features
\begin{itemize}
	\item DNA/RNA (A,T/U,C, G)
	\item Proteins with the same 20 L amino acids
	\item Genetic Code
	\item Ribosomes
	\item Biochemistry (e.g. ATP)
	\item Particular genes
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

Life is a self-propagating chemical system capable of undergoing adaptive evolution--adapted from \cite{deamer1994origins}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ''Self-propagating'' includes growth and cellular reproduction 
	\item ''Adaptive evolution'' entails the potential to complexify and become more out-of-equilibrium--Figure \ref{fig:AdaptiveEvolution}
	\item Self-propagation and evolution are key
\end{itemize}

\section{Chemical Origins}
\subsection{Introduction}

We will discuss likely chemistry of the early Earth, chemistry that may be to be fundamental to the origin of life, what we know is essential for biochemistry of modern life, processes that can occur in chemical dynamics, and extreme life that occurs today in a variety of environments.


\subsection{What Did Early Earth Look Like?}

\subsubsection{Geochemical Landscape}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\caption{Geochemical Landscape after \cite{kitadai2018origins}}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{GeochemicalLandscape}
\end{figure}

  
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item  Definitely an ocean that was warmer than today, probably saltier.
  	\item Landmasses from volcanic activity, and, maybe, plate tectonics.
  	\item On continents, lakes and ponds from precipitation.  Maybe temporary streams from precipitation.
  	\item Surfaces composed of minerals, which were good for catalysis and energy production. Today covered with life.
  \end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Mixing processes between chemical reactors}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\caption{Mixing processes between chemical reactors \cite{stueken2013did}}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{MixingProcesses}
\end{figure}
Chemical reactions mixed by a variety of processes.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Tides
	\item Evaporation and aerosols
	\item Volcanic plumes
	\item Hydrothermal vents
\end{itemize}
  
  
\subsubsection{Geothermal systems}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\caption{Geothermal systems \cite{damer2016field}}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{GeothermalSystems}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide high 	temperature, high
	pressure, reduced	reaction products
	\item Fresh water from 	precipitation
	\item Diversity of mineral	surfaces for ”nutrients” and catalysis
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Energy Sources}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chemical Energy
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reducing gases
		\item Radiation
		\item Minerals
	\end{itemize}
	\item Other Energy Sources
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Volcanic lightning
		\item UV-light
		\item High temperature
		\item Pressure
		\item Impacts
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Miller Urey. Maybe no methane, but CO2 to dive different mixture.

\end{figure}

Each meteorite has different chemical library

Enough material to jump start life

Bombardment

Samples and surface are (mostly) undisturbed
• Samples can be dated ( 40 Ar/ 39 Ar, 87 Rb/ 87 Sr, etc.)
• Craters can be counted
Lunar cratering rate anchors
the impact chronology for the
entire (inner) Solar System

Late Heavy Bombardment

\subsection{Likely Environments for Studying Origins of Life}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\caption{Life probably started between 4.4 to 3.8 billion years ago (Ga) \cite{domagal2016astrobiology}}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{LifeProbablyStarted}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\caption{Earth during the Hadean Eon was probably very inhospitable for life} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{HadeanInhospitable}
\end{figure}
 Magma Oceans formed because of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Comets and meteorite impacts
	\item Tidal heating (moon/Earth)
	\item Core formation (plate tectonics)
\end{itemize}

Plate tectonics helped make the early Earth environment favorable for life

Global oceans probably covered the surface of the Earth by the Archean Eon



\begin{figure}[h!]
	\caption{Life took hold on Earth during the Archean Eon} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Chemolithoautotrophs}
\end{figure}

The first likely signs of life in the rock record dates back to 3.5 to 3.3 Ga

\subsection{Chemistry and The Origins of Life}

Tar problem: Biomolecules plus heat and time = black sludge.

\begin{itemize}
	\item What molecules can be and are created without life?
	\item How can these molecules be made to react in a life like manner?
	\item How can formation of wasteful byproducts like	tars be prevented?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Why Nature Chose Phosphates}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Structural
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Nucleic Acid Backbones (Figure \ref{fig:PhosphoDiesterBond}-\ref{fig:PhosphoDiesterBond3})
		\item Phospholipid Bilayers (Figure \ref{fig:PhosphoLipid1}-\ref{fig:PhosphoLipid3})
	\end{itemize}

	\item Physical\begin{itemize}
		\item Compartmentalization
		\item Signaling
	\end{itemize}
	\item Chemical
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Energy
		\item Activation
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

Why wouldn't you use phosphate?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Scarce
	\item Insoluble, unreactive
	\item No polyphosphate minerals
	\item One pyrophosphate mineral
	\item Limited geochemical production of reactive forms
\end{itemize}
Open Questions

\begin{itemize}
	\item When did life begin to use 	phosphate?
	\item If not at the very beginning, what 	came before?
	\item Where did early phosphate come 	from?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why Water? Why Carbon?}
Figures \ref{fig:abundances1} and \ref{fig:abundances2} show abundances. Figure \ref{fig:minerals} shows elements likely to be locked up in minerals, Figure \ref{fig:volatiles} shows elements that are likely to be in atmosphere or sea. Bonds are important - carbon has 4.

Water is abundant, stable, and a liquid.

What are the other possibilities?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Silicon
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can adopt similar structures to carbon
		\item Poor reactivity with many other elements
		\item Reactive with water
	\end{itemize}
	\item Borane
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Diverse Chemistry
		\item Unstable in Oxidizing Environment
		\item Low Cosmic Abundance
	\end{itemize}
	\item Metal Oxides (?)
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	Less diverse chemistry
	\item Demonstrated biomimetic functions
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

What are the other possibilities for solvents?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammonia
	\item Urea
	\item Formamide
	\item Alkanes
\end{itemize}

Open Questions
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are the surface and atmospheric chemistries of
	exoplanets?
	\item How much of extant biochemistry can be accomplished
	in other solvents?
	\item How much of extant biochemistry can be mimicked with
	other substrates?
