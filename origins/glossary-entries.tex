\newglossaryentry{gls:aldose} {
	name=aldose,
	description={An aldose is a monosaccharide (a simple sugar) with a carbon backbone chain with a carbonyl group on the endmost carbon atom, making it an aldehyde, and hydroxyl groups connected to all the other carbon atoms. Aldoses can be distinguished from \glspl{gls:ketose}, which have the carbonyl group away from the end of the molecule, and are therefore ketones--\cite{ wiki:aldose}}

\newglossaryentry{gls:arrheniusequation}{
	name={Arrhenius Equation},
	description={In physical chemistry, the Arrhenius equation is a formula for the temperature dependence of reaction rates. The equation was proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1889, based on the work of Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff who had noted in 1884 that van 't Hoff equation for the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions--\cite{wiki:arrheniusequation}
	\begin{align*}
	k =& e^{\frac{-E_a}{k_B T}}\text{, where}\\
	k =& \text{rate constant,}\\
	T =& \text{the absolute temperature (in Kelvin),}\\
	A =& \text{the pre-exponential factor, a constant for each chemical reaction. According to collision theory, A is the frequency of collisions in the correct orientation,}\\
	E_a =& \text{the activation energy for the reaction,}\\
	k_B =& \text{the Boltzmann constant.}

\newglossaryentry{gls:deamination}{
	name={deamination},
	description={Deamination is the removal of an amino group from a molecule. Enzymes that catalyse this reaction are called deaminases--\cite{wiki:deamination}}}

\newglossaryentry{gls:DNAmethyltransferase}
	{name={DNAmethyltransferase},
	description={In biochemistry, the DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase) family of enzymes catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to DNA. DNA methylation serves a wide variety of biological functions. All the known DNA methyltransferases use S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor--\cite{wiki:DNAmethyltransferase}}}

\newglossaryentry{gls:enthalpy}{
	name={enthalpy},
	description={A property of a thermodynamic system, is equal to the system's internal energy plus the product of its pressure and volume. In a system enclosed so as to prevent matter transfer, for processes at constant pressure, the heat absorbed or released equals the change in enthalpy--\cite{ wiki:Enthalpy}}}

\newglossaryentry{gls:furan}{
	name={furan},
	description={Furan is a heterocyclic organic compound, consisting of a five-membered aromatic ring with four carbon atoms and one oxygen. Chemical compounds containing such rings are also referred to as furans--\cite{wiki:furan}}
}

\newglossaryentry{gls:gibbs-free}{
	name={Gibbs free energy},
	description={A thermodynamic potential that can be used to calculate the maximum of reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure (isothermal, isobaric). The Gibbs free energy is the maximum amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a thermodynamically closed system (one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings, but not matter); this maximum can be attained only in a completely reversible process--\cite{wiki:gibbs-free}}}

\newglossaryentry{gls:ketose}{
	name={ketose},
	description={A ketose is a monosaccharide containing one ketone group per molecule. The simplest ketose is dihydroxyacetone, which has only three carbon atoms, and it is the only one with no optical activity. All monosaccharide ketoses are reducing sugars, because they can tautomerize into \glspl{gls:aldose} via an aldol intermediate, and the resulting aldehyde group can be oxidised, for example in the Tollens' test or Benedict's test. Ketoses that are bound into glycosides, for example in the case of the fructose moiety of sucrose, are nonreducing sugars--\cite{wiki:ketose}}

\newglossaryentry{gls:r-K-selection}{
	name={r/K selection},
	description={In ecology, r/K selection theory relates to the selection of combinations of traits in an organism that trade off between quantity and quality of offspring. The focus on either an increased quantity of offspring at the expense of individual parental investment of r-strategists, or on a reduced quantity of offspring with a corresponding increased parental investment of K-strategists, varies widely, seemingly to promote success in particular environments--\cite{wiki:k-r-selection}}}

\newglossaryentry{gls:oligotroph}{
	name={oligotroph},
	description={An oligotroph is an organism that can live in an environment that offers very low levels of nutrients. They may be contrasted with copiotrophs, which prefer nutritionally rich environments. Oligotrophs are characterized by slow growth, low rates of metabolism, and generally low population density --\cite{wiki:oligotroph}}}

The molecular formula is C5H6O. There are two isomers of pyran that differ by the location of the double bonds.

\newglossaryentry{gls:ribozyme}{
	name={ribozyme},
	description={Ribozymes (ribonucleic acid enzymes) are RNA molecules that are capable of catalyzing specific biochemical reactions, similar to the action of protein enzymes. The 1982 discovery of ribozymes demonstrated that RNA can be both genetic material (like DNA) and a biological catalyst (like protein enzymes), and contributed to the RNA world hypothesis, which suggests that RNA may have been important in the evolution of prebiotic self-replicating systems.[1] The most common activities of natural or in vitro-evolved ribozymes are the cleavage or ligation of RNA and DNA and peptide bond formation.[2] Within the ribosome, ribozymes function as part of the large subunit ribosomal RNA to link amino acids during protein synthesis. They also participate in a variety of RNA processing reactions, including RNA splicing, viral replication, and transfer RNA biosynthesis. Examples of ribozymes include the hammerhead ribozyme, the VS ribozyme, Leadzyme and the hairpin ribozyme--\cite{wiki:ribozyme} }}
