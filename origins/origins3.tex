 	These are my notes from Week 1 of the \gls{gls:SFI} Origins of Life Course\cite{sfi2019}. The course aims to push the field of Origins of Life research forward by bringing new and synthetic thinking to the question of how life emerged from an abiotic world.\\

\section{Introduction}

This week is a more detailed look at biochemistry: biological information encoded in chemistry; the chemical processes that drive organization; and how life extracts energy from its environment.

\section{DNA as Information}
Lecturer: Michael Lachmann, \gls{gls:SFI}

In this section we see that DN is noisier than we think. Error rate $10^{-10}$ errors per (replication*bas pair)
\subsection{DNA as Information - I}

The are a couple of bacteriophages, PBS1 and PBS2, that contain Uracil instead of thymine in their DNA\cite{hemphill1975bacteriophages}. Either the thymine has been replaced, or these phages are more primitive, and never used thymine.

When people talk about methylation of DNA, they usually mean $5-methylcytosine$, Figure \ref{fig:5methylcytosine}, even though there are many other ways to do it
\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{$5-methylcytosine$ } \label{fig:5methylcytosine} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{5-methylcytosine}
\end{figure}

Methylation tends to occur when C is followed by G. The methylated versions are replicated us unmethylated C, but there is an enzyme, \gls{gls:DNAmethyltransferase}, which performs methylation, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:5-methylcytosine-in-action}. This can carry epigenetic changes across cell divisions, and sometimes across generations. This is important as it means that a lever cell can "remember" that is comes from a liver cell.

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{5-methylcytosine-in-action}
\end{figure}

6-Methyladenine is also important--Figure \ref{fig:6-Methyladenine}-- in bacteria, where it carries information regarding the old strand versus the new. The methylation isn't very fast, so it can distinguish old from new. Section \ref{section:DNAasInfo2} shows how this is useful for repair.

\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 44 DNA mod
	\item 112 RNA mod
	\item Many survive 	replication
	\item Some are replicated themselves
	\item Functional: 5mC, 6mA, 5hmC, RNA \&more
	\item Generated:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Enzyme activity
	\item Damage
	\item Misincorporation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Where did the modifications come from? They could be fairly new, and we use them in various ways; or maybe they tell us something about the origin of DNA. Maybe there are many enzymes left over from before we had sophisticated machinery for DNA replication.
