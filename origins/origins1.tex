\section{Welcome To The Course}

Lecturer: Chris Kempes


How life originated is one of the most interesting, complicated, difficult, and still open questions in modern science. Throughout this course, we're going to
introduce to you to why it's such a tricky question, and all the different ways that people are trying to solve this unanswered question.	

Since the time of Darwin, we've come to understand how life
progresses, changes, diversifies, finds new niches, evolves greater complexity
And yet we still don't understand how to take that back to
the original formation and initiation and origin of life.


So, in saying that it's important to recognize that life lives on a spectrum--Figure \ref{fig:lifesTransitions}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption[Life lives on a spectrum]{Life lives on a spectrum, which goes from a completely abiotic world
		all the way up to multicellular creatures like us, and entire societies.}\label{fig:lifesTransitions}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{lifesTransitions}
\end{figure}
At some point along this trajectory, we have this transition into something
that we would call life. And so how is it that we go from this
abiotic world to a biotic world understanding that this is all part of one
evolutionary continuum. So why is that question so challenging?

Well, one of the things that makes it
challenging is that it requires
a lot of diverse types of knowledge to
begin to understand
this process and to answer this question.
And so those types of knowledge draw from
a variety of different disciplines--Figure \ref{fig:tradional:disciplines}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\caption[Traditional disciplines needed for Origin of Life]{We need to understand something about Earth science, biology, chemistry, and physics and how all of these different concept areas intersect with one another and help us to understand exactly what happened when life first formed.}\label{fig:tradional:disciplines}
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{4mainAreas}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Throughout this course, we will introduce you to the main questions in each of these concept areas and how they relate to the origins of life. And we will also start to begin to paint a picture of where the intersection and synthesis of these different concepts live, hopefully moving towards a better theory of how life started and evolved into
greater complexity.

So within these concept areas, what are the main questions? 

\subsection{Earth Science}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What was the environment like during the time when life originated?
	We understand that the early Earth was 	very different than the modern Earth.
	\item What chemistry was possible on the early Earth? We need to understand something about what chemistry was possible then and how that might come together to help 	life form in the first place.
	\item What was the diversity and complexity of various micro-environments on the early Earth? So if we think about the early Earth, not
	only as a different average chemical
	space than what we currently have, but
	also lots of different unique types of
	micro-environments existing in this very
	different planetary environment, which of
	those micro-environments were most likely
	to give us life in the first place or to
	have the right type of chemical complexity
	to at least start down that trajectory
	towards a living organism.
	
	\item How did early life and the geosphere co-evolve? 
	So we understand in the modern Earth, how
	life interacts with the overall planetary
	system, we understand through lots of the
	history of life how life interacts,
	has a large feedback width, and modifies
	the geological environment and the
	geosphere. And the question is when life
	first started, "how did that--what did
	that feedback look like and what did this
	coevolution--how did this coevolution
	happen and how important was that for the
	specific trajectory that life took once
	it was formed?"
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Biology}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How do we wind the clock back from modern life to early life? From a biological perspective, the questions we're interested in are mostly 	how do we take everything we know about
	modern life and try to work as far back in
	time as we can? So how do we wind back the
	clock on modern life to understand what
	early life might have looked like?
	This involves taking a lot of
	phylogenetic or genetic perspectives to
	look back in time.
	\item  What does the composition, structure, and function of modern life tell us about the origin?
	\item  Which aspects of extant life are general and which are arbitrary?
	\item How do we apply modern evolutionary theory to the proto-life? Also in that vein, how do we take
	everything we know about modern
	evolutionary theory and start to apply that to things like protolife which
	might have a much less formal version of
	inheritence or genetics,
	how can we use evolutionary theory to
	think about the simplest early life which
	might be radically different but also is 
	almost certainly undergoing some sort of
	evolutionary process. So, what are the features that we see in
	modern life that are really essential to
	life through any origin and trajectory and
	which are contingent on the particular
	evolutionary history that we happened to
	have seen in--for more recent life.
\end{itemize}	


\subsection{Chemistry}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How does life arise from the huge space of chemical reactions and compounds? 
	So we understand that chemistry gives us
	this really vast set of possibilities,
	this really rich high-dimensional space,
	which is great for allowing something
	like life to form but it makes it very
	complicated to understand exactly what
	combinations and processes and
	trajectories are actually necessary or
	were the ones that led to the life that we
	have.
	\item What was early “living” chemistry like? What was that-- how was
	that possible in early Earth? And how do
	we start to define sort of living
	chemistry that isn't quite life?
	\item How do we go from complicated chemistry in an environment to the amazing chemical complexity of even the simplest cells? So even the simplest cells have a set of 	chemistry and feedback and dynamics and 	interconnections that is much more 
	complicated than things that we see in the 	environment and so how do we make that
	transition?
\end{itemize}

	
\subsection{Physics}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How do physical constraints, such as the laws of thermodynamics, bound the possibilities for life? How do we take everything we know about
	physics and use that to say what is and
	isn't possible for life, especially as it 
	first forms.
	\item What properties and processes are “easy” to obtain through physical dynamics alone?	So for example, we understand that in
	purely physical systems, it's possible to
	get very rich pattern information and
	dynamics and so how much-- how important
	are those sorts of naturally emergent--
	occurring phenomena to thinking about the
	first formation of life and how we start
	to apply some of those concepts of
	emergence and simple pattern formation to
	interact with
	how life began in the first place.
	\item How do we generalize physical concepts to understand life’s formation? So how do we port physical concepts over
	to biology in general and in particular,
	how do we port those ideas over to the
	origins of life?
\end{itemize}	

So, as you can see this is a very rich
set of questions coming out of a variety
of concept spaces across a huge range of
science and in this course we've gathered
people from this wide diversity of
scientific perspectives to really layout
the details of each of these questions in
specific ways and then bring those details
together in a way that we have a broader
and more complete understanding of how
life might have formed in the first place.



\section{Life}
Lecturer: David Baum
\subsection{Easy or hard?}
A key initial consideration is how easy, or hard, is it for life to emerge?
The extremes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We need to wait billions of years for specific conditions: even hospitable planets lack life--Figure \ref{fig:luca}.
	\item New life can evolve quickly whenever conditions are ripe:  New life could emerge in the lab--Figure \ref{fig:zircons}.
\end{itemize}

Of course this isn't really a dichotomy, as there is a continuum from easy to hard.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption[Life is hard.]{Life is hard; Time is long. A key piece of evidence comes from looking at cellular life and tracing it back to a single ancestor--\gls{gls:LUCA}. If life were easy one might expect multiple independent trees.}\label{fig:luca} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Luca}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption[Life emerged quickly]{Life emerged quickly: The oldest rocks that could have retained evidence of life do have evidence of life. We now don't know any rock formation that doesn't have evidence of life. This figure depicts some including in zircons\cite{bell2015potentially}, and the isotopic ratios suggest the carbon was from life.}\label{fig:zircons} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Zircons}
\end{figure}

 Even if life arose only once, it nevertheless happened remarkably early, since Figure \ref{fig:zircons} dates from shortly after the planet had cooled enough to provide liquid water. To help us think about that we can turn to Charles Darwin.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Life preempts Life: ''But if (and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some warm little pond with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts,—light, heat, electricity etc present, that a protein compound was chemically formed, ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured, or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed''--Charles Darwin\cite{darwin1871letter}. So the fact that life only emerged once does not necessarily mean that life is hard.
	
	\item Do we know that all life on this planet is cellular? Would we recognize alt-life?
	
	\item Some theories allow life to originate easily\cite{wachtershauser1988before}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The meaning of ''life''}
\gls{gls:LAWKI} shares many features
\begin{itemize}
	\item \gls{gls:DNA}/\gls{gls:RNA} (A,T/U,C, G)
	\item Proteins with the same 20 L amino acids
	\item Genetic Code
	\item Ribosomes
	\item Biochemistry (e.g. \gls{gls:ATP})
	\item Particular genes
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{\acrfull{gls:LAWKI}}\label{fig:LUCA_figs} 
	
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
		\centering
		\caption{A reflection of common ancestry}\label{fig:LUCA_common} 
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{LUCA_common}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
		\centering
		\caption{Focus on generic features...but which?}\label{fig:lawki-focus} 
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{lawki-focus}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\gls{gls:life} is a self-propagating chemical system capable of undergoing adaptive evolution--adapted from \cite{deamer1994origins}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ''Self-propagating'' includes growth and cellular reproduction 
	\item ''Adaptive evolution'' entails the potential to complexify and become more out-of-equilibrium--Figure \ref{fig:AdaptiveEvolution}
	\item Self-propagation and evolution are key
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{''Adaptive evolution'' entails the potential to complexify and become more out-of-equilibrium}\label{fig:AdaptiveEvolution} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{AdaptiveEvolution}
\end{figure}



\section{Nonequilibrium Physics}

Lecturer: Eric Smith, External Professor, Santa Fe Institute.\\
\\
Topics covered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The equilibrium concept of phase transition
	
	\item How phase transitions explain robust patterns
	
	\item Why equilibrium isn’t enough to understand life
	\item Phase transitions in dynamical systems ''frozen motion''
\end{itemize}

The ''ordinary'' response of thermodynamic systems to controls. E.g. lava: Viscosity increases smoothly as temperature is lowered. Phase transitions are different
\begin{itemize}
	\item Water does not become harder as it is cooled
	\item It turns to ice suddenly (critical temperature)
	\item The average direction of pointing of the ice sharply increases from zero at the freezing temperature
	\item The direction and strength of the crystal is called the ''Order 	Parameter'' of the transition
	\item Change is sudden because ''you can’t have half a symmetry''
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A direction either exists or it doesn’t
		\item All frozen directions are equivalent
	\end{itemize}
	\item Phase transitions, cooperatively-maintained states, and robustness
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Diamonds are hard because many atoms lock each other in place
		\item The order of the crystal is a ''robust'' property of freezing
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Evolution happens on a background of robust architectures
\begin{itemize}
	\item Universal small metabolites
	\item RNA and proteins
	\item Cellular and genomic individuality
\end{itemize}

Equilibrium ideas are not enough to explain the robust order of life (Chicken vs. chicken soup)


The Miller-Urey synthesis of amino acids\cite{miller1959organic}

Life is made of interlocking structures and processes: can phase transition ideas
be applied to these?

What might be the order parameters of life?

\begin{itemize}
	\item They would be chemical and energetic
	\item They would involve interdependent	structure and process
\end{itemize}

The characteristic molecules
\begin{itemize}
	\item Unchanging universal roles 	for small metabolites
	\item Key macromolecules such as RNA
\end{itemize}

The great biogeochemical cycles
\begin{itemize}
	\item Life alters cycling of Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulfur, and more
	\item New compounds are also formed of 	these elements
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{The great biogeochemical cycles\cite{falkowski2008microbial}}\label{fig:biogeochemical} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{biogeochemical}
\end{figure}



\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Earth’s energy throughput: the Biosphere changes the way a planet converts sunlight into heat.\cite{meadows2005modelling}}\label{fig:EnergyThroughput} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{EnergyThroughput}
\end{figure}

The emergences of individualities
\begin{itemize}
	\item Individuality takes many 	forms
	\item The order parameters in individual-based systems 	are proper names
\end{itemize}

Take-home messages from the lecture:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Phase transitions are one way natural systems  spontaneously form order
	\item The order is robust due to mutual reinforcement
	\item Phase transitions can also lead to spontaneous order in processes like fractures
	\item Candidates for living order parameters include chemical cycles and individuality
\end{itemize}

\section{Constraining Chemical Complexity to Form Life}

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{MolecularInteractions}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Constrain Location 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Advantages
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Many possibilities for
			complex interactions
			\item Experiments can be
			designed by analogy
		\end{itemize}
		\item Disadvantages: mostly implausible to
		assume pure reactants in
		natural settings
	\end{itemize}
	\item Constrain Reactants
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Advantages: limit to needed molecules and needed amounts.
		\item Disadvantages: resulting network is not very complex or robust
	\end{itemize}	
	\item Constrain Energy Sources
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Advantages: processes are not location-
		or reactant-specific; many
		outcomes are possible
		\item Disadvantages: Difficult or impossible to
		predict outcomes of
		processes that cross
		multiple object levels
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Examples
\begin{itemize}
	\item Constrained Location Examples \begin{itemize}
		\item Hydrothermal Vents\cite{martin2006origin}
		\item Atmosphere (Impactor/Shock Synthesis, Lightning,
		Insolation)\cite{chyba1992endogenous} and \cite{miller1959organic}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Constrained Reactant Examples 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item RNA World\cite{powner2009synthesis},
		\item Pyrite-mediated synthesis\cite{wachtershauser1993cradle}
		\item Borate-mediated synthesis\cite{grew2011borate}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Constrained Energy Examples
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \gls{gls:serpentinization}\cite{schrenk2013serpentinization}
		\item Solar flares\cite{airapetian2016prebiotic}
		\item Radioactivity\cite{yi2018radiolytic} and \cite{adam2018estimating}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Geological Conditions, Change, and Chaos}

Zach Adam, University of Arizona\cite{spencer2017growth}

What is the source of our understanding of conditions when we thought life originated?
\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Earth's Structure: includes everything in Figure, plus minerals, etc. Can only sample surface, plus a few km down.}\label{fig:EarthStructure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Another Level Down: different models for accumulation of crust. Not simple accumulation!}\label{fig:AnotherLevelDown} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{AnotherLevelDown}
\end{figure}

Only direct record for events that sow chaos and processes of prolonged gradual change

What does this mean for origins of life research?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Limited direct rock data
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	Sampling and preservation
		biases abound!
			\item No rock packages to
		provide environmental
		context or views into surface
		conditions.
		\item 	No rocks and few minerals
		from time surrounding life’s
		origins.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Complementary lab data
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Experiments are critical for
		filling in where the rock
		record is not available.
			\item Unclear whether powerful
		events/energy are more
		constructive than destructive.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Pattern Formation in Chemical Systems}
Chris Kempes

\begin{itemize}
	\item What properties and processes are easy to obtain through physical dynamics alone?
	
	\item How might this make it easy for lifelike things to begin?
	
	\item Reaction Diffusion Equations\cite{sfi_grayscott2018}
\end{itemize}

Describe reaction of $U$ everywhere in space.
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t} =&   \underbrace{\overbrace{D_V}^\text{diffusivity} \underbrace{ \nabla^2 U }_\text{difference in fluxes}}_\text{diffusion term} + \underbrace{ F(U)}_\text{reaction term}
\end{align*}

With two chemicals...
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t} =&   D_U \nabla^2 U + F(U,V)\\
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} =&   D_V \nabla^2 V + G(U,V)
\end{align*}

Consider two reacting species, $U$ and $V$, and an inert product $P$.
\begin{align*}
U + 2V \Longrightarrow& 3V\\
V \Longrightarrow& P\\
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t} =& -U V^2 + \overbrace{F}^\text{Fixed flow into system (chemostat)} (1 - U) + D_u \nabla^2 U \\
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} =& U V^2 - (F +\underbrace{f}_\text{loss to make $P$}) V + D_v \nabla^2 V 
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Grey Scott Reaction}
	
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
		\centering
		\caption{Starting configuration}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{GreyScottInitial}

		\centering
		\caption{Evolves toward steady state,  where high concentration close to low concentration. Segregation.}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{GreyScottFinal}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

Other starting values give cell-like behaviour (including division), so maybe get some ''lifelike" behaviour from physics and simple chemistry.

\section{The Central Dogma of Biology}


\subsection{The Central Dogma of Biology}

How do we unwind present day life to learn about origins? Focus on most common properties of all life, especially the Central Dogma.\cite{crick1958biological} \cite{crick1970central}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{The Central Dogma after \cite{crick1970central}}\label{fig:CentralDogma} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{CentralDogma}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Ribosome is conserved across life, but appears to have onion structure, built up by evolution. Ribosome started with common core, and more added.\cite{hsiao2009peeling}.}\label{fig:Ribosome} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Ribosome}
\end{figure}
Williams argues that we can use the onion, Figure \ref{fig:Ribosome}, to unwind evolution.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Ribosome Phases after \cite{petrov2015history}}\label{fig:RibosomePhases} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{RibosomePhases}

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{LandauerRibosome}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Life is only 20 times less efficient that physical limit\cite{kempes2017thermodynamic}
	\item Computers are 20 times worse than Landauer's bound!
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{For small cell, \gls{gls:DNA} and proteins take up (nearly) entire volume; for large cells, Ribosome does same thing! So we have bounds on allowable volume.\cite{kempes2016evolutionary}}\label{fig:RibosomeTradeoffs}

\end{figure}

\section{Biological Similarity}

Sarah Mauer: ''By examining and deconstructing the commonalities between modern living organisms, we can understand the requirements of first life.''

\begin{itemize}
	\item L-amino acids for all proteins;
	\item D-sugars for all sugars and nucleic acids.
	\item Use membranes: amphiphilic molecules with hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic end.
	\item All cells use proteins, same 20 amino acids.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Comparison of similarity allows for the
		construction of a tree, outlining evolution. Large part of conserved set involved in Central Dogma, and also metabolic.}\label{fig:Phylogeny}

\section{Selection Theory}
Chris Kempes

\subsection{Quasispecies equation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How do we think about evolution in a simple, mathematical way?
	\item Start with binary Genome. One string can change into another via point mutations.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Topology of genome -- point mutations represent edges}\label{fig:GenomeTopology} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{GenomeTopology}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Fitness Landscape, showing maximum fitness.}\label{fig:FitnessLandscape} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{FitnessLandscape}
\end{figure}

Introduce \emph{Quasispecies equation}.
\begin{align*}
\dot x_i =& f_i x_i - \phi x_i \text{, where $x_i$ is frequency of sequence $i$, $f_i$ is fitness, $\phi$ is death term.}\\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \dot x_i =& 0 \text{, assume constant population}\\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i - \phi \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i =& 0\\
\phi =& \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i f_i\text{, since $\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i = 1$}
\end{align*}
Hence $\phi$ is \emph{average fitness}. But this leaves out \emph{mutation!} Include $q_{ij}$, the probability of mutation from $i$ to $j$.
\begin{align*}
\dot x_i =& \sum_{j=1}^{n} f_j q_{ij}x_j - \phi x_i\text{, full quasispecies equation} 
\end{align*}

NB. See Figure \ref{fig:GenomeTopology} - point mutations much more likely than 2-point, etc.

\subsection{What are the basic ways in which we think about evolution?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How do we generalize evolution?
	\item How do we use this to think about origins of life? 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Simplify to \emph{Master Sequence}, $f_0$ with all less fit sequences lumped as $f_1$.}\label{fig:SteadyStateSolution} 
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{SteadyStateSolution}
\end{figure}

\begin{align*}
\dot x_i =& \sum_{j=1}^{n} f_j q_{ij}x_j - \phi x_i\\
f_0 >&1, f_1 = 1\\
q_{00} =& (1-u)^L \triangleq q\text{, where $u$ is mutation rate, $L$ = length of genome}\\
q_{01} =& 1-q\\
q_{11} =& 1\text{, $L$ is large, so 1$\rightarrow$1} \\
q_{10} =& 0\text{, $1\nrightarrow0$}\\
\phi =& \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i f_i\\
\text{Whence,}\\
\dot{x_0}=&f_0 q x_0 - \phi x_0\text{,}\\
\dot{x_1}=&f_0 (1-q) x_0 + x_1 -\phi x_1\text{, and}\\
\phi =& f_0 x_0 + x_1 \text{. But} \\
x_0 + x_1 =& 1\text{, so we have}\\
\dot{x_0}=& x_0 \big[f_0 q -1 - x_0 (f_0 - 1)\big]
\end{align*}
Now we can look for a steady state solution:
\begin{align*}
x_0^* =& \frac{f_0 q - 1}{f_0 - 1}\text{, se we need}\\
f_0q >& 1 \text{, if the master sequence is to persist. I.e.}\\
u <& log(f_0)\\
log(f_0) >& -L log(1-u)\text{. Now we assume $L<<1$, and find}\\
u <& \frac{log(f_0)}{L}\text{, which is known as the \emph{Error Threshold.}} 
\end{align*}
The Error Threshold is the \emph{maximum mutation rate that allows for adaptive evolution!} NB: it is more sensitive to $L$ than to $f_0$.

\subsection{Quasispecies and Error Catastrophe}

Michael Lachmann

We look at growth of types, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Genome in population
	\item Molecule in test-tube.
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
\vec{x}^{\,t} =& W M \vec{x}\text{, where M represents mutations, W growth, e.g.}\\
M =& \begin{bmatrix}
1-\mu & 0\\
\mu& 1
\end{bmatrix}&
\end{align*}
Let us diagonalize WM
\begin{align*}
WM =& VDV^{-1}\\
(WM)^t =& V D^t V^{-1}
\end{align*}
So $D^t$ is dominated by its largest eigenvalue.

Figures \ref{fig:ErrorCatastrophe1} and \ref{fig:ErrorCatastrophe2} show that master sequence lost if mutation rate is too high.
