## Journal

| Date | Remarks |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|24&nbsp;Apr&nbsp;2018| Started. Created repository and Wrote up Proposal |
| 27 Apr 2018 |Started implementing focal rules as in the original El Farol paper. Also started reading the Kolkaka Paise restaurant papers. Think about criteria for evaluating rules, e.g. review every n iterations to see whther I could do better, review against target performance, etc.|
| 8 May 2018 | Started on machine Learning after Fogel. I need to think through starting conditions. Is there enough time to start the way Fogel does? |
| 9 May 2018 | Started new version of model, using links for assignments to pools. Size of Fish (investors) indicates wealth, and happ/sad face indicates whether pool has paid off.|
| 10&nbsp;May&nbsp;2018| Performed experiments on function closure. Bindings captured as doco indicates. Also function can recurse. So will use a function for predictor, withone argument indicating whther we want to initialize, predict or train.|
| 11 May 2018 | Learning is converging to same estimates |
| 13 May 2018 | I've digressed into working out how to use RMarkdown for writing up the challenge |
| 23 May 2018 | Digression into game theory |
| 24 May 2018 | Experiencers need to collect knowledge first. This is an optimal stopping problem |
